# Citibike-NYC
Module 14
Overview- 
This Project was to provide the data for a company that wants to start up a new business In the city of Des Moines Iowa. This Idea came from a company in NYC 
called citibike which is where people rent bikes and travel around the city as a way of touring the city or even exploring and sight seeing the city. 
It shows the whole city map as well as the metrics system in measuring miles, lengths and distance per square mile of land. 
In the city of Des Moines they want to create the same Idea and the same concept of purchasing Bikes and then Renting them out. 

For Starting a new business there is always the overview of cost or Supply and Demand For staring a company.
